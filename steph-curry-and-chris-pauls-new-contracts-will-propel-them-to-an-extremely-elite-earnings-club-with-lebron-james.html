We’ve seen players switch teams, sign and trades, and of course, some major money exchanging hands. <a href=# rel=noopener>Steph Curry</a> is one of the biggest beneficiaries after agreeing to a $215 million extension with the Golden State Warriors that will keep him in the Bay Area through 2025-26. And <a href=# rel=noopener>Chris Paul</a> also signed perhaps <a href=# rel=noopener>his final large deal</a>, a four-year extension with the Phoenix Suns worth $120 million.</span></p><p><span>It’s the second contract in excess of $200 million Curry has signed. His current deal, worth $201 million over five years, ends at the end of next year. In the final year of Curry’s new deal (the 2025-26 season), he’ll make $59.6 million.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>With the signing, Curry and Paul will join <a href=# rel=noopener>LeBron James</a> as the only players to earn more than $400 million on the court throughout their careers.&nbsp;</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-322494 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/GettyImages-1150201526.jpg alt width=1024 height=683 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-322494 class=wp-caption-text>Jonathan Ferrey/Getty Images</p><p><span>James has already made more than $349.3 million from NBA salaries over his career. He has around $85.5 remaining on his contract. And he’s still playing at a high level, so it’s not entirely out of the question that he could reach half a billion dollars in on-court earnings.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Paul, who entered the league two years after James, has made just a little over $300 million. His newest contract with the Suns will top him off at $420 million by the time it’s through.</span></p><p><span>Curry is well behind James and Paul (and several other players) in terms of total earnings right now, with about $212 million earned. That difference makes sense; Curry joined the league in 2009, four years after Paul and six after James. However, by the end of his new deal, Curry will easily surpass the $400 million mark.</span></p><h2><strong>Who Is The NBA’s Highest Single-Season Earner?</strong></h2><p><span>These massive deals for superstars are incredibly lucrative, but as of right now, the highest single-season salary adjusted for inflation still belongs to a contract from 1997-98. That’s when the Chicago Bulls paid Michael Jordan $33.14 million for his last one in Chicago. Accounting for inflation, Michael made the same as $55.8 million that season</span></p><p><span>Curry will surpass that in modern dollars by the final year of his new contract. And along the way, he’ll reach a financial pinnacle that only an elite few will manage.</span></p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on celebritynetworth.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6toq6Saval5wq6pq7FdlrulecKhqaKrXaWutrjSZqWer12YvK%2FA0ZqaratdrLatuIypqaiolaF6tbTEpmStp12Wu26x162pnqWVocZuscuiq55llZa%2Fr7XNoKpmm5yqr27DyK2fZqSVl7%2BwuoyjmKado2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
