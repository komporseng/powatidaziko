Ive been getting alot [sic] of props in the breasfeeding [sic] community and get tons of emails from woman/moms appreciating me bringing light to the subject .. I write a baby blog about my journey with Chanel and soon I will write about what it’s like to continue boob time with a 4 year old.. I get tons and tons of requests that want me to speak on it!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>She continued, “At this point in nursing its just for comfort and believe me the girl loves meat so its not like she isnt [sic] eating real food…😁Thank you to all that understand my view.. i see most of you are so eager to side with me and I too root for you in your journey as well.. Us moms are connected.” Last September, Coco opened up about breastfeeding Chanel, who was then-3, and was met with tons of support from her followers. Then, Coco called breastfeeding a “mother’s calling” and admitted when Chanel was first born, she had a difficult time producing milk and almost gave up.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“I’m lucky she hasn’t grown out it yet because when that moment comes I will be so sad..its the best feeling and ALL mothers that nurse know,” she wrote. “I nursed all 4 of my sons my first and my 3rd for 3 years and my 2nd and 4th weened themselves after a year. My 1st and 3rd never get sick. It’s from nursing them for so long. Nothing can compare to mothers milk. Great job babe,” one follower praised.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=nofollow>View this post on Instagram<p id=content-paragraph-4></p></a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>At a time when the world feels like its coming to an end.. suck up as much love as you can!
