But it was only after 2022 that he stepped into the international limelight, not as a musician, but as </span><i><span>Bling Empire</span></i><span> star Kim Lee’s ex-boyfriend — who allegedly “betrayed” her.</span></p><p><span>Learn all about him; his age, net worth, and more as you scroll down.</span></p><h3><b>Meet Keith Ape, Bling Empire Kim Lee Ex</b></h3><p><span>The name Keith Ape was first heard on </span><i><span>Bling Empire</span></i><span> season 2 after Kim Lee talked about a previous trauma from her past relationship. At the time, Kim had just broken off with Kevin Kreider, after she heard that Kevin was hooking up with another girl — just like her ex, Keith, who “betrayed” her.</span></p><p><span>Also, it was her past relationship with Keith that led Kim’s trust issues to run so deep. No wonder, she encouraged Kevin to take a lie detector test to prove his intentions with her.</span></p><p><span>However, Keith never confessed to cheating on Kim. But a lot of people have connected the dots and argue that such severe trust issues regarding infidelity don’t just pop up out of nowhere</span></p><p><span>Initially, Keith and Kim first connected through mutual friends, and since they were both private people, they immediately fell in love.

I’m damaged inside, I’m still in the healing process,” Kim explained to her mother on </span><i><span>Bling Empire</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>So, after a traumatic experience with Keith, Kim had finally opened up to Kevin Kreider by the end of </span><i><span>Bling Empire</span></i><span>’s season 1 and gave love a second chance by season 2, only to again be “betrayed.”</span></p><p><span>Prior to Keith, Kim was briefly involved in a romantic relationship with singer Dustin Breeding, a member of American R&B music group</span><i><span> B5</span></i><span>, in 2007.</span></p><h3><b>Keith Ape Wife Now</b></h3><p><span>Keith Ape has always been a private person.
