In the United Kingdom, meanwhile, about 200 have been found in total.</p><p>Most recently, one containing human teeth, fish hooks, and a mysterious liquid were <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">discovered during roof repairs</a> on the former home of 18th-century witch Angeline Tubbs.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-260297 alt="Witch Bottle With Top And Without" width=900 height=505 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/witch-bottle-with-top-and-without.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-260297 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Robert Hunter/William & Mary Center for Archaeological Research</span><span class=caption-body>About 200 witch bottles have been found across the United Kingdom, while fewer than a dozen have been unearthed in the U.S.</span></p><p>Whoever this particular bottle belonged to, Jones explained, was scared enough of being killed in battle to actually use one.</p><p>With the 5th Pennsylvania Cavalry Regiment being under regular threat from Confederate troops, one could see how even metaphysical solutions like witch bottles would start to be considered under fear of death.</p><p>“Given the perceived threat of Confederate attack and general hostility of local residents, he had good reason to pull all the stops and rely on folk traditions from his community in Pennsylvania to help protect his temporary home away from home,” Jones explained.</p><p>As the age-old maxim reminds us, there are no atheists in foxholes. While some in modern-day warfare might say a prayer, those embattled in Virginia during the Civil War opted for witch bottles.</p><p>After learning about the Civil War-era witch bottle discovered near Williamsburg, Virginia, read about <a href=#>the historical origins of the witch</a>.
