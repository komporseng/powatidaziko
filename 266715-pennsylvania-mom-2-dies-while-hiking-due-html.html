The incident, which also left her husband Paralyzed, transpired when a misplaced tree branch fell on them.</p><p class=fh>A 40-year-old Pennsylvania mother, Kara Leo, was out hiking with her husband Jared Quinteros in the Boyce Mayview Park when they had an accident. Records showed that a huge tree branch fell on them.</p><p class=fh>The incident left Quinteros, paralyzed, and Leo was reported dead the next day at the UPMC Mercy hospital.

Her husband would also have to go through many recovery processes since he lost a part of his body and wife.</p><p class=fh>Leo was well known in her area for her incredible baking skills. Jeff Iovino, Leo's neighbor, who owns the cafeteria next to hers, in an interview described Leo as "the best." He also <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://people.com/human-interest/penn-mom-of-2-killed-by-falling-branch-while-hiking-with-husband/>said</a>:</p><p class=fh>"She was just the sweetest person in the world. She loved to create, she loved what she did, she loved her family, she loved to be outside."</p><p class=fh>According to Leo's obituary, she graduated from Mt. Lebanon High School in 1999, and in 2003 she graduated from Johnson and Wales University, where she earned a degree in baking and pastry arts.</p><p class=fh>In another update, a Waterville lady died during a high wind on Knowlton Corner Road in Farmington.
