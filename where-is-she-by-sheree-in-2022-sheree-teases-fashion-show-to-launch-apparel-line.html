Now it seems like Shereè is finally ready to relaunch her clothing line this year, and she is going all in.</p><p>Shereè made some money in 2017 by selling her "Who Gon' Check Me Boo?" shirts at Nordstrom, and only now is she ready to take the next step. Get ready for the launch of her apparel business, '<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">She By Shereè</a>', over a decade later. <a href=# rel>Andy Cohen</a> approached Shereè about the apparel line during the 2018 reunion, and her instant answer was "joggers." Many fans were perplexed, but she later stated that she was working on a lifestyle <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">apparel brand</a> for She By Shereè. Earlier this season, the cast member of 'The Real Housewives of Atlanta' stated why "no one has ever seen" so many of her product innovations.</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'RHOA' Season 14: Who is Fatum Alford?

While Shereé hasn't revealed a particular release date, she did discuss some of the issues that have been holding her label back on the June 19 episode of 'The Real Housewives of Atlanta.' "SHE by Shereé, I gotta admit, its been kind of a mess," she revealed during an episode interview. "Over the years, I've stopped and started SHE by Shereé. I've even created a line of accessories, like yoga mats and water bottles, but no one has ever seen these things."</p><p>Shereé announced at the RHOA Season 10 reunion in April 2018 that she will be releasing a line of joggers later that year, however, the pants were never launched. Shereé claimed two years later, during a May 2020 interview on 'Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen,' that she "decided to go in a different direction" and stop making joggers entirely. In the present day, Shereé has a new strategy for her brand. "The next step is to find a great business manager to help build my team of strong, diverse women," she announced in the episode airing on June 19.</p><p>Shereé can be seen acquiring raw materials for her upcoming clothing line in a BravoTV clip that was recently released. She approaches Britney at a boutique for stretch and knit fabric, since she doesn't want to put anything out there while updating her apparel line. She's attempting to have things in order before her apparel launch. Furthermore, she explains that she is planning a massive fashion show to celebrate the launch. She adds that her clothing brand, which began as a women's line, has received so much interest from guys that she is considering doing something else for them as well.</p><p>When Shereé says she wants "VPL" apparel, both Brittany and her coworker Mimi seem perplexed. Then she goes on to explain that she's seeking apparel with a "Visual Print Line," which will allow people to sneak a peek at the men's junk. She admits in a confessional that both men and women "want a little something to see every now and then," so she'll give them what they want!</p><p>Will She By Shereè finally have the launch she has been dreaming of? Check out the new episode of 'Real Housewives of Atlanta' on Sunday at 8 p.m EST only on BravoTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5iav6Z5yKxkrKCVYq%2B6edKhnKudlWK2r3mRaWlrZaOdsrOxxGarnpmjmsBussCsn6KnnmLAqbvWZquoZZyWwq%2Bvx2aYqaiRp7KtecuipZ4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
