She has previously denied taking illegal substances, despite getting hit with a 30-day suspension last August after her first violation.</p><p>However, in the latest episode of “Total Divas,” she revealed what she says is the real reason she was banned. Filmed last year, Paige had just learned of her suspension from the WWE and broke down crying.</p><p>“WWE posted a statement about me failing the wellness policy,” she said. “We get drug tested all the time&nbsp;… first of all, I don’t do drugs. Second of all, I did the test and I passed it. They’re only suspending me because I didn’t take it in the allotted time that they gave me.”</p><p>That incident started several months of hell for the British wrestler — who is currently on hiatus due to injury.</p><p>Earlier this year, explicit images and videos of the former Divas champion engaging in sex acts with two separate male wrestlers were leaked online.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/04/042017-wwe-paige-1.jpg><p>Paige, who is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the focus of a Hollywood film</a> being made by Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, is seen in one of the clips using her former title belt <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in a sordid act</a>.</p><p>At least things now seem to be looking up for Paige, who <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">recently married former WWE star Alberto Del Rio</a>.</p><p>Speaking prior to tying the knot with the Mexican star, who has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">publicly defended his partner</a>, Paige admitted <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she thought of harming herself</a> as her world crumbled.</p><p>“I made a big mistake. Huge. I put trust in the hands of someone that took advantage of a young girl years ago,” she said. “It was my mistake and I’ll always take responsibility — but the one thing that was the hardest was thinking ‘my husband is gonna leave me, my family will disown me.’ But I’m blessed beyond words to have a family and a husband that stuck by me because they know who I am.</p><p>“They know I’m not a bad person and they held my hands through hell. Because as my husband says, ‘You may feel like the devil is throwing you into a storm, but just remember, you are the storm.’ And he’s right. But we are human. Unfortunately, people don’t see it that way when they are behind a keyboard. They don’t think that we have feelings or that we don’t suffer. Not only was I a victim of viral humiliation, but a victim of cyber-bullying. I had days where I wanted to physically harm myself.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlfnh7j21ma2hfqbWqv4yiqmavmJq%2FpnnToZxmppmctbW5wKucZpqVnK6vecWoqWavp5p6tMDAq2SpmZmcsnA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
