However, several fans have expressed their disappointment at a recent celebrity revelation.</p><p class=fh>Earlier today, the reality competition show, "The Masked Dancer" shared a revelation on Twitter – that rapper Ice-T was behind the famous Disco Ball character.</p><p class=fh>The tweet showed Ice-T – real name Tracy Lauren Marrow – dressed up as his Disco Ball character as he spoke about a wide array of things – from his decision to try dancing to his costume choice.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/a1371424ca389deced7d99257f865452.jpg><p class=xj data-testid=image-source>ICE T performs at the Uncle Jamm's Army Reunion at The Savoy Entertainment Center on October 28, 2017 in Inglewood, California | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=fh>As expected, the tweet also showed Ice-T in action, with the rapper strutting his stuff to "Uptown Funk" by Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars. Of course, dancing is not what many would associate Ice-T with.</p><p class=fh>However, he explained that he always viewed himself as a dancer. The rapper <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/MaskedDancerFOX/status/1343378713665220608>explained</a>: "Honestly, back in the day, I danced. So I can dance… but not, more of my dancing is in my mind."</p><p class=fh>While the rapper's selection seemed like a fun one, some fans were not pleased. Many expressed their displeasure at the selection on Twitter, with someone claiming that he always knew the rapper <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/nightfury558/status/1343383612700372993>was the Disco Ball</a>.</p><p class=fh>Another problem seemed to have been Ice-T's performance. One Twitter user claimed that it was <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/guaco_leaks/status/1343406724506677248>a total rip off</a>, while another added that the rapper <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/terencej_cole/status/1343378996415762434>had been too slow</a>.</p><h3 class=kh><strong class=dh>It appeared that the rapper's concern with not falling affected his dance routine.</strong></h3><p class=fh>Ice-T's performance marked the first episode of "The Masked Dancer," itself a spinoff of the wildly popular show "The Masked Singer." Sadly, it was not quite enough to keep him in the show as <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://ew.com/tv/recaps/masked-dancer-season-1-episode-1-premiere/>he was ultimately unmasked</a>.</p><p class=fh>Speaking to news sources, the rapper explained that he enjoyed his time on the show. However, he also blamed his costume on his performance. In part, he <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://ew.com/tv/the-masked-dancer-disco-ball-ice-t-interview/>said</a>:</p><p class=fh>"Once you put that 20-pound head on[...] You're just concerned with not falling…I threw all the choreography out the window."</p><p class=fh><a class="Ed a" href=#>Ice-T</a> added that he did not want to "bust his <i class=eh>[</i>expletive<i class=eh>]</i>" on TV like that. It appeared that the rapper's concern with not falling affected his dance routine.</p><p class=fh>All in all, it appears that "The Masked Dancer" is off to a great start. Viewers are already hooked, and there will be more revelations to come. Fans have already <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.bustle.com/entertainment/masked-dancer-season-one-costumes-theories-judges-spoilers>begun sharing theories</a> as to who the characters would be.</p><p class=fh>Names like Grammy-winning singer Taylor Swift, Olympic gold medalist Simone Biles, and Emmy-winning actress Zendaya have already been thrown into the mix. With more weeks to go before the final, the revelations are sure to be an incredible lineup of people.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtrbm5iZ3qurdKknJ1llJa7pLHRZqernZ2esrOxjKucr52RocBusMismqhlkpa5b7TTpqM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
