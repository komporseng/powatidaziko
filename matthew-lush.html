There, he is seen in his most raw and unabashed self. Even though Lush is the icon of all things insane and hilarious, his journey to finding this stage was a rather rocky one, filled with anguish and trauma.</p><p>Growing up, his gay and vegan lifestyle attracted a lot of hate, especially from his mother and friends. The downtrodden eventually started looking for a friend over the internet. And to his relief, he found an online chat friend who lived across the state.</p><p>During this time, he fell in love with his first boyfriend and then created a ‘MySpace’ page. It was created just to post and share pictures of this newfound romance with the unknown internet clan. Before things could pick up the pace, his page found a boom of followers that loaded him with appreciation and love. And many of them even hailed him as the ‘Gay God.’</p><p>With an idea that struck him like a bolt, Lush changed his ‘MySpace’ name to ‘GayGod’. Soon after moving in with a friend, he started a YouTube channel. And then, uploaded eccentric videos that shot him to the 7th Most subscribed channel at that time.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-48287 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Matthew-Lush-video.jpg alt="Matthew Lush" width=650 height=365 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-48287 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Matthew Lush while making a YouTube video.
