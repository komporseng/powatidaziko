The only part of her body showing that wasn’t painted were her hands. Doja opted out of any makeup, letting the paint do all the talking while her eyebrows were <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>completely shaved off</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>As for her outfit, Doja rocked a fitted brown plaid blazer that was off-the-shoulder on one side and featured a plunging neckline. She chose to go braless under the top which had a longer version of a blazer underneath. She <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>styled the top</a> with a pair of matching, skintight trousers with super wide-leg hems and topped her look off with a long brown leather SIMONMILLER Jetz Coat with white fur inside. A cream fur purse and gold hoops with ball accents completed her funky outfit.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Since fashion month started, Doja Cat has rocked a slew of incredible outfits and one look that is loving is body paint. Just a few weeks ago she was at <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>New York Fashion Week</a> when she attended the Vogue World: New York show with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>white face paint</a> covering her head. The face paint looked like a cow pattern as it was cut out in some spots. This time, she chose to wear makeup, rocking a dark black cat-eye and a bold brown lip. She styled her glam with a white knit crop top, matching high-slit skirt, a white fur jacket, and cow-print knee-high boots.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe49tZp2nmpZ6pK3TZp6opJRis6KvxGaZqJypYr2itc2tZKmZop7AbrLArJ%2Bip55ixKaxymanoaekpMBw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
