Thompson didn’t sugarcoat the truth that it had been a horrible, horrible event for her.</p><p>Thompson also revealed how a man was discovered in her California home by a house-sitter named Ryen Russillo, who was waiting for his apartment to be ready, rather than by her or the police, to demonstrate how her safety and privacy had been violated.

Thompson immediately filed a lawsuit.</p><p><strong>“When it comes to your physical being and intimate photos between you and your boyfriend and things that you sent to someone when you were in a long-distance relationship and love, it is your private property,” she told The Athletic in a June interview.
