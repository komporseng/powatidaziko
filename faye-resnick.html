The two women have some bad blood, stemming from one of the biggest names in history: O.J. Simpson.</p><p>To play catch up: Edwards confronted Resnick on RHOBH — at a dinner party, of course — about what Resnick wrote about Edwards in her 1994 book. The conversation didn’t go well for either woman, but it definitely did raise the question of what exactly was written about Edwards in the book, and if it is as character-damning as Edwards alleges.</p><p>Just months after her close friend, Nicole Brown Simpson, was killed, Resnick released Nicole Brown Simpson: The Private Diary of a Life Interrupted, and Edwards’ name is brought up in the text.

Bustle reached out to Jenner for comment but has not yet received a reply.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-916 data-method=placement-service></span><p>Edwards seems to want to air all of her grievances with Resnick now that the two women are running in the same circle. Resnick, on the other hand, doesn’t seem to be willing to talk about that time in her life at all, probably because the first time it was brought up on RHOBH this happened.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><h2 id=h-faye-resnick-oj-simpson>Faye Resnick OJ Simpson</h2><p>Faye Resnick was reviled during the O.J.
