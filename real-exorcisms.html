Religious iconography was said to make her convulse. She suddenly seemed to have the strength of an adult and could purportedly speak various foreign languages that she had never learned.</p><p>When Father Horner and Reverend Mansueti reported to their superiors that she had levitated, they received permission to conduct an exorcism. According to accounts of the exorcism <a href=# rel=noopener>published</a> in the 1930s, the ritual lasted two full days.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-344468 alt="Real Exorcisms Clara Germana Cele" width=800 height=640 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/crosses-in-a-field.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-344468 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>mwwile/Flickr</span><span class=caption-body>While the young girl was purportedly saved from her alleged demons, she died of heart failure at 22.</span></p><p>Erasmus and Mansueti began their ritual cleansing at dawn on Sept. 11, 1906, and went late into the night. Father Erasmus and his nuns allegedly claimed she had once transformed into a serpent and bitten one of the women trying to help her. Later, they said Cele had attempted to strangle one of the priests during this time and knocked a Bible out of his hands.</p><p>They administered their religious rites again the following morning, at which point the demon vacated the girl’s body and forced her to levitate one last time. According to accounts, 170 people were present to witness Clara Germana Cele’s possession and real-life exorcism.</p><p>In the end, she died of heart failure six years later at the age of 22.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyzscClZJ6wn6ewqr%2FMrGZv</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VibeX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
