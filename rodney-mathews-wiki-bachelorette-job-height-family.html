Cintas, in their words, has been helping businesses of all types and sizes get Ready for the Workday with products and services that help them keep their facilities clean, safe, and looking their best.</p><p>Rodney graduated with an associate’s degree from Citrus College where he listed football captain as an activity. Later, he transferred to California State University, Fresno, where he continued his football career. There, from 2013 – 2015, he also studied for his bachelor’s degree in Mass Communication/Media Studies.</p><p>So, during his collegiate career, he was a defensive back for the bulldogs. He played his university’s first two games before suffering a season-ending knee injury. And just like that, his dreams of playing in the NFL were shattered.</p><p>Nevertheless, Rodney picked himself up and redirected his ambition, working as an intern at ABC 30 Action News, associate sales representative at Smith & Nephew, and a service advisor at Toyota North America, one after the other. Also, over the years, he learned to enjoy his profession.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Rodney Mathews Family</strong></h3><p>Rodney Mathews is the son of&nbsp;Carrie Mathews-Myers and Tyree Myers.

I thank God every day for blessing me with this angel. I love you, Mom!”</p><p>He says he is ever thankful for her for showing him how to grind and make it through life.</p><p>“You had to be moms and pops for a long time and I don’t know how you raised 2 boys on your own but you did. I’ll never stop striving to be like you. You’re my hero I love you.”</p><p>Rodney is just as much proud and fond of his “Lil brother” Royal “Roy” Mathews. Royal turned 25 years old on 14 November 2020.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li style=text-align:left><h4><strong>How Old Is Rodney Mathews?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Because Rodney was born on 25 March 1992, he reached the age of 29 in 2021.</p><ul><li style=text-align:left><h4><strong>Where Is Rodney Mathews From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Rodney comes from Rancho Cucamonga, a city that is located just south of the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains and Angeles National Forest in San Bernardino County, California, in the United States.</p><ul><li style=text-align:left><h4><strong>How Much Is Rodney Mathews Net Worth?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Rodney Mathews had an estimated $200 thousand net worth when the world first knew about his Bachelorette stint.</p><ul><li style=text-align:left><h4><strong>Is Rodney Mathews On Instagram, Facebook?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Rodney is on Instagram <a href=#>@rodneymathews02</a>.
