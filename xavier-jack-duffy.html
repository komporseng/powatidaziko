However, the administrators of his school (before Wausau East High School) bizarrely deemed the meaningful remembrance as ‘alt-right’ and ‘Islamophobic’.</p><p>Since having his YAF chapter axed by intolerant administrators, this person has increased his work to reach and mobilize young conservatives. He did so by helping launch Young Americans for Freedom chapters at five other schools in his community.</p><p>He also helped continue to organize YAF activism projects for his peers at off-campus venues.</p><p>Moreover, his increased involvement is also a continuation of his family’s work. His parents are frequent speakers at YAF conferences.
