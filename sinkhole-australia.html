Back in&nbsp;Sept. 2015, a similar sinkhole appeared just a few hundred meters away from the site of this latest crater. Another one appeared in 2016 as well, and authorities believe that this latest sinkhole won’t be the last one that’s seen in the area.</p><p>“We could see another one in 12 months, or we could see one in a few years,” Peter Davies from the University of the Sunshine Coast&nbsp;told the&nbsp;<a href=#>Australian Broadcasting Corporation</a>. “All we can say with any certainty is that it’s an inherently unstable area and will do this periodically.”</p>Helicopter footage of the sinkhole<p>Sinkholes typically happen when rainfall seeps into the soil, causing the ground to be less stable and effectively fall into itself. This particular occurrence happened because of tidal flow from the ocean.</p><p>Geotechnical engineers are currently monitoring and examining the situation. There are no reported injuries at this time, though a man’s car and caravan have fallen victim to the expanding hole.</p><p>Next, read about <a href=#>Australia’s little-known 19th century genocide</a>.
